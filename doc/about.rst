About us
========

Origin
------

TensorLy was created in 2015 by `Jean Kossaifi`_ to make tensor methods accessible and easy. 
It was first presented at the 
NeurIPS `workshop <https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6230>`_ 
on "Learning with Tensors: Why Now and How?" and 
later published as a `JMLR paper <http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-277.html>`_ titled
"TensorLy: Tensor Learning in Python", 
by `Jean Kossaifi`_, `Yannis Panagakis`_, `Anima Anandkumar`_ and `Maja Pantic`_.

Originally, TensorLy was built on top of NumPy and SciPy only. In order to combine tensor methods with deep learning and run them on multiple devices, CPU and GPU, a flexible backend system was added.
This allows algorithms written in TensorLy to be ran with any major framework such as PyTorch, MXNet, TensorFlow, CuPy and JAX.
