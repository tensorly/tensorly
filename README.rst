TensorLy
========

TensorLy is a fast and simple Python library for tensor learning. It builds on top of NumPy, SciPy and MXNet and allows for fast and straightforward tensor decomposition, tensor learning and tensor algebra.

How to install
--------------
 
Easy option: install with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply run::

   pip install -U tensorly
   
NOTE: TensorLy is developed/tested only for Python 3

That's it!

Alternatively, you can pip install from the git repository::

   pip install git+https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly

Second option: install with conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply run::

  conda install -c conda-forge tensorly

That's it!

Development: install from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library is still very new and under heavy developement. To install the last version:

Clone the repository and cd there::

   git clone https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly
   cd tensorly

Then install the package (here in editable mode with `-e` or equivalently `--editable`)::

   pip install -e .

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing and documentation are an essential part of this package and all functions come with uni-tests and documentation.

You can run all the tests using the `nose` package::

   nosetests -v tensorly
