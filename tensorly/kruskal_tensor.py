        ``factor_matrices = [|U_1, ... U_n|]`` becomes
        a tensor shape ``(U[1].shape[0], U[2].shape[0], ... U[-1].shape[0])``

    Parameters
    ----------
    factors : ndarray list
        list of factor matrices, all with the same number of columns
        i.e. for all matrix U in factor_matrices:
        U has shape ``(s_i, R)``, where R is fixed and s_i varies with i

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        full tensor of shape ``(U[1].shape[0], ... U[-1].shape[0])``

    Notes
    -----
    This version works by first computing the mode-0 unfolding of the tensor
    and then refolding it.

    There are other possible and equivalent alternate implementation, e.g.
    summing over r and updating an outer product of vectors.

        turns ``factors = [|U_1, ... U_n|]`` into a mode-`mode`
        unfolding of the tensor

    Parameters
    ----------
    factors : ndarray list
        list of matrices, all with the same number of columns
        ie for all u in factor_matrices:
        u[i] has shape (s_u_i, R), where R is fixed
    mode: int

    -----
    Writing factors = [U_1, ..., U_n], we exploit the fact that
